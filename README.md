XML validation against XSD schema for NativeScript projects.
=======================================

How to use
----------
```
$ npm install nativescript-dev-xmlxsd
```

The above command installs this module and installs the necessary hooks. XSD validation of all XML files inside `app` folder happens when the project is prepared for build.
